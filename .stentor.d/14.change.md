The repository for a project must be a http or https URL.
This breaking change is required
to support privately hosted repositories
with the built-in templates.

API changes:
- `release.New` now returns a `*release.Release` and an `error`
- Config structs moved
  from the `main` package in `cmd/stentor`
  to a new `config` package,
  so that they are importable.
- `SectionConfig` is now `config.Section` to comply with go naming rules.

Behavior changes:
- `config.ValidateConfig` returns an error
  if `repository` is not parseable by `url.Parse`
  or is not a http or https URL.
