Fixed an issue where `stentor` could fail to find the start comment.

The original way `stentor` scanned for the start comment
worked so long as the newline after the comment
didn't align just after the end of the internal read buffer.
To fix that,
stentor now scans the end of the read buffer
looking for partial matches with the start comment.
